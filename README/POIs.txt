The file for POIS is the latest version of the POIS after all the proceesing is done. 

In our system SCD and POIs are large datasets. It wont be easilyshare by email or github

Therefore, I have extracted the necessary/latest version of the files over here, which you can use in the code and see/understand the structure of the model with evaluation analysis. 

If you like to process POIs and SCD with your own methodology, data is available (exceptSSCD, because they have labelled based on activities). Please let me know.
